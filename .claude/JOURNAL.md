# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initialized jupyterlab_kernel_terminal_workspace_culler_extension as a new JupyterLab extension project with Claude Code configuration<br>
    **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with workspace import directive linking to `/home/lab/workspace/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, reinforcing mandatory bans for git operations and package management. Created `.claude/JOURNAL.md` for tracking substantive work. Updated README.md with standardized badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, downloads, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal) and concise feature list. Extension provides automatic culling of idle kernels, terminals, and workspaces with configurable timeout settings. Project uses TypeScript frontend with Python server extension targeting JupyterLab 4.x.
